Questions
1. Which incurred_org do we want to use?
    Should it be all Viasat that worked on the program or just Atlanta based ones maybe?


    The following orgs had task names related to Guam (currently location of antenna installs), and/or frequently showed up when checking which orgs worked on the programs Reign gave.
        --
        "Eng - GSN System Int & Test Government", 
        "Eng - AS", "Facilities - Georgia", 
        "SGS",
        "GSD", 
        "75", 
        "VWS", 
        "Eng - CN Deployment Eng"

        --
    Note: Should check project numbers Reign gave.

2. There is also "task_carrying_out_org" - does that imply the organization carrying out the task is different from the organization that incurs the cost? For programs Reign gave


3. What is the difference between 'pc' and 'pfc'? 
    Many columns end in either _pc or _pfc


4.  I'm not able to find any of the product names (e.g. TH2000, 3440 upgrades, X/V Systems) that Reign gave us in the data, but they can be inferred from the project/program names


5. Is AWS 6 Pack 5.4M the right AWS program under the X/V upgrades product? Lots of projects with RTE in the name. Same with NBN and others. Need more specific project names.

Questions:
what is glc, task level, mpm_export_flag, far_required_flag, transfer_from_project_flag - and why would riptide have all nulls for this?
What exactly are we accounting for? Temp labor? Per diem? Is burden cost more important or raw labor cost? Which roles or tasks should be included?
What is expenditure_start and expenditure_ending_date?











General Notes:
- AS = Antenna Systems
- Burden includes overhead, overhead depreciation
